        description: 'This project had some interesting challenges. First, the only hardware I had available was an Arduino Pro Mini, whose memory was much smaller than the size of an animation. Second, I couldnâ€™t just move the animation to a separate file and let the Arduino read from that file because I did not have an SD card integrated into the Arduino and Arduinos cannot access files from computers. To solve these problems the project consists of three separate pieces of code. First, a method of creating an animation for the lights of a Christmas tree. Second, once the animation had been made and compiled to custom byte code, code needed to be made to communicate between my machine and the Arduino through the serial port. Finally, code needed to be created on the Arduino to receive the data from the serial port, show the data on the lights, and request more data from the animation. ',

        description: 'Implementation of an arbitrary precision unsigned integer. This project is the improved version of the following project. In this project I replaced the std::bitset from the BigInteger project with an std::vector<bool>. This allowed for higher precision than in the BigInteger project and a potential speedup from not having to store hundreds of bits when only few are needed. For most operations, almost no changes needed to be made from BigInteger. The only real changes were made with when bits needed to be pushed or popped. Additionally, I moved the string manipulation operations into the same header file as the bit manipulations. I also simplified the string to uInteger conversion method. I also used uIntegers to convert uIntegers to strings by repeatedly dividing the number by 10 and saving the remainder. I used this implementation to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to the 100,000th term. The decimal output was 20,900 decimal digits. However, This calculation took 41 minutes and 11 seconds. I would like to spend more time optimizing this implementation.',

In order to make the visualizer more visually interesting we used a stacked bar graph to add dynamic colors and "falling bars." In order to use the dynamic colors, the num_of_bars variable in CLICK_ME.m can be changed to change the number of colors. The color scaling works by using a pre-defined color map. The falling bar was achieved by adding a bar the same color as the background and having a matrix of "differences" which would slowly lower each iteration. Unfortunately, it is difficult to record this as MatLab's graphing functions tend to use a lot of processing power. Despite this, I still embedded a video of the visualizer to show the concept.`,
