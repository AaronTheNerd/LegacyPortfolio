    <h3>Languages</h3>
    <hr>
    Listed below are languages which I have used in a school, work, or personal setting. I don't
    want to claim that I am an expert in any of these languages. However, I believe that if I had
    to code in a professional setting with any of these languages I could learn enough to reach
    that point. Additionally, I any languages which have a listed percentile was obtained from
    <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/aaron-barge">PluralSight</a>.
